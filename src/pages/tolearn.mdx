## About &gt;&gt; To learn

Some things in my "To learn" or "Getting into" list:

- Gaming
- [Japanology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_studies)  
  Like many otakus, it all started with "I want to understand anime without subtitles" for me. Thanks to [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/) and [Remembering the Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi), I have been able to maintain a good pace.
- [Ambidexterity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambidexterity)  
  This has improved a lot because of cubing but my handwriting with non-dominant hand still needs a lot of work.
- Memory tricks  
  Currently reading [Remember It!](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38657042-remember-it) by **Nelson Dellis**. A while ago, I tried reading [Secrets of Mental Math](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83585.Secrets_of_Mental_Math) by **Arthur Benjamin** but couldn't complete. Learned some very cool tricks though. I want to work on my personal [mind palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci) when I get the time to.
- Card tricks and cardistry  
  I know a few card trick routines, shuffles, and mathematical tricks from **Scam School**, **Martin Gardner** and YouTube but I want to learn more of it. I like mathematical tricks that "just work" more than sleight of hand but cardistry certainly seems cool.
- Animation
- Juggling
- Yoyoing
- Harmonica
